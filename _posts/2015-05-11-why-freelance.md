description: A journey to become a more responsible human being.

3 years ago I graduated from high school. I had 4 internships in tech companies and Google Summer of Code experience behind by back. I knew I wanted to stay in young and dynamic world of web development but had no clue what company to apply for.

So I made a crazy decision to become a freelance software developer with zero real world work experience selling my services and working on my skills as I go.

First two years were the hardest. I failed to convince potential customers why they should hire inexperienced software engineer (a.k.a me) so many times, I started to feel like I was a church-sect follower knocking on people's doors selling crazy version of the bible.

Constant rejections and search for customers taught me valuable lessons in self-marketing and customer acquisition.

My family and my belief system are the two most crucial aspects of my life. Knowing that I live for more than just myself, that I have a family to support gives me a warm feeling and motivation to press on for an few hours longer at nights.

I believe in personal responsibility of individuals. Coming from a very liberal country which Estonia is I learned a lesson early: our luck and success is in our own hands. Sure enough not everyone can become a billionaire or a president but I strongly believe that anyone can become a millionaire if they apply themselves in the right ways.

I am not talking about working hard. I am talking about working hard AND smart. Becoming a millionaire requires either solving really challenging problems or solving simple problems in a new and groundbreaking ways. The approach will be different for everyone. We all can succeed in our own ways because we all come from different backgrounds and bring unique experiences into this world.

> All humans are capable of reaching greatness, it's a shame many don't even try.

Freelancing is my attempt to achieve greatness. Not so much for the financial or social aspects of it but for becoming a better person along the way.
